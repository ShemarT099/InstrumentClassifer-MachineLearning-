# InstrumentClassifer-MachineLearning-


This project uses machine learning tools and algorithms to train the computer to recognize pre-labelled instruments based solely on their sounds.

Each instrument has it's own .wav file and there are 30 versions of 10 instruments

A MelSpectrogram from the librosa library was used to extract the features of each sound as each .wav file was iterated through. 

These features would then be assigned to a label to be prepared for a supervised learning model.

# Applications

This is a program that demonstrates an algorithm's performance and accuracy at detecting muscial instruments with only playing a few seconds of music

# How to use?

To use this application, one can open this on a kaggle or jupyter notebook and then run each cell
